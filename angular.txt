Basic commands: 

ng new <name> => creates a new workspace and an initial project inside
ng serve -o  => it builds the application, starts development server, watches the source files + rebuild the application when we make changes
ng generate component <component_name>, e.g.: ng generate component rooms or using shortcut ng g c rooms 

When we make any changes in angular.json file, we have to restart the server, those changes are not watched.
