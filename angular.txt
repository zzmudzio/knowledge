Basic commands: 

ng new <name> => creates a new workspace and an initial project inside
ng serve -o  => it builds the application, starts development server, watches the source files + rebuild the application when we make changes
ng generate component <component_name>, e.g.: ng generate component rooms or using shortcut ng g c rooms 

When we make any changes in angular.json file, we have to restart the server, those changes are not watched. 

Module is a mechanism to group components, directives, pipes that are related. Module is created by using @NgModule decorator. Inside decorator there are a few properties, e.g.: 

imports => expects an array of modules
declarations => expects an array of components
bootstrap => here we define a root component of our module 

=====

Displaying values using interpolation: 

Declaration in class:
myValue = "sometext";
.. then in the template:

<h1> {{ myValue }} </h1> 

Property binding:

Declaration in class:

someVar = "color: red";

then in template:

<p [style] = "someVar"> Text </p> 

So the "Text" message will be written using a red color. 

====

Directives:

*ngIf => it is a directive that conditionally display a template if condition is true. 

<div *ngIf="condition"> <p> Some template in here </p> </div>

*ngFor => it is used to traverse over an array and display the data inside the UI 

<ng-template *ngFor="let element of myArr"> {{ element }} </ng-template>


*ngSwitch
ngClass
ngStyle
