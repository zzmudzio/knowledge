--- Switch ----

Is used for forwarding traffic in a LAN(Local Area Network)

Examples of switches are: Catalyst 9200, catalyst 3650

They have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to(usually 24+)

They do NOT provide connectivity between LAN/s / over the Internet. 

--- Routers ---

Example of routers are: ISR 1000, ISR 900, ISR 4000

They are used to provide connectivity between LANs. They have fewer network interfaces than switches. 
They are used to send the data over the Internet. 

--- Network Firewalls ---

They are a special devices that controll entering and leaving network traffic. 
They can be placed outside of the router and inside of the network. 
They have to be configured with given security rules to determine which traffic should be allowed and which not. 

Example firewalls: ASA5500-X, Firepower 2100

Next-Generation Firewalls are the ones which include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities. 
The above mentioned models are considered as next-gen fws. 

--- Host-based firewalls ---

They are a software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine.
