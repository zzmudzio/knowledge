==== NETWORK DEVICES ===

- Client -> it is a device that accesses a service made available by the server
- Server -> a device that provides functions or services for clients


--- Switch ----

Is used for forwarding traffic in a LAN(Local Area Network)

Examples of switches are: Catalyst 9200, catalyst 3650

They have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to(usually 24+)

They do NOT provide connectivity between LAN/s / over the Internet. 

--- Routers ---

Example of routers are: ISR 1000, ISR 900, ISR 4000

They are used to provide connectivity between LANs. They have fewer network interfaces than switches. 
They are used to send the data over the Internet. 

--- Network Firewalls ---

They are a special devices that controll entering and leaving network traffic. 
They can be placed outside of the router and inside of the network. 
They have to be configured with given security rules to determine which traffic should be allowed and which not. 

Example firewalls: ASA5500-X, Firepower 2100

Asa stands for adaptive security appliance. 

Next-Generation Firewalls are the ones which include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities. 
The above mentioned models are considered as next-gen fws. 

--- Host-based firewalls ---

They are a software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine. 


==== INTERFACES AND CABLES ===

RJ - Registered Jack
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

--- Ethernet standards(copper) ----

Speed	Common name	IEEE Standard	Informal name	Max length
10 Mbps  Ethernet	802.3i		10BASE-T	100m
100 Mbps Fast Ethernet	802.3u		100BASE-T	100m
1Gbps	 Gigabit Eth.	802.3ab		1000BASE-T	100m
10Gbps	 10 Gig Eth.	802.3an		10GBASE-T	100m

--- UTP Cables ---

UTP - unshielded twisted pair - no metallic shield so vulnerable to electromagnetic interference(zakłócenia)

There are 8 pins, 4 pairs

-- Ethernet, Fast Ethernet --

Ethernet, Fast Ethernet use 2 pairs(4 wires).

Full Duplex - two devices can send and receive data on the same time. 

PC sends data on pins 1,2 and receives on 3 and 6. 
Switch sends data on pins 3 and 6, and receives on 1 and 2. 
Router sends data on pins 1,2 and receives on 3 and 6. 
Firewall sends data on pins 1,2 and receives on 3 and 6. 

-- Straight through cable ---

Pin 1 on one end of the rj 45 copper cable connects straight through to the pin 1 on the other end etc.

-- Crossover cable ---

Pin 3 on one end of the rj 45 copper cable connects to the pin 1 on the other end etc.

Switch:

Pin 1 < 3 
Pin 2 < 6
Pin 3 > 1
Pin 6 > 2 
	
---- Auto MDI-X -----

It helps to detect which pins are used by their neighbour to transmit data and adjust their pins to adjust and receive the data. 

--- Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gig Ethernet --- 

They use all 4 paris of the pins. 

Each pair is bidirectional, so it can receive and send the data. 

--- Fiber Optic Cable --- 

fiber optic - światłowód

Instead of electric signal of copper wire, they send the light through the glass fibers.

SFP Transceiver - Small Form-Factor Pluggable 

The fiber optic cables have 2 connectors on each end - one for sending and one for receiving data. 
They use separate cable for receiving and sending data. 
Transmit on the left is being connected to the receive on the right. 
Transmit on the right is being connected to the receive on the left. 

Structure of the fiber optic cable is: 

- fiber glass core - light is being transmitted down this core,
- cladding(okładzina) that reflects light,
- protective buffer(protects from breaking),
- the outer jacket of the cable 

--- Single mode and multimode fiber --- 

Multimode fiber:
 - core diameter is wider than single mode fiber, 
 - allows multiple angles(modes) of light waves to enter the fiberglass core 
 - allows longer cables than UTP but shorther than single mode 
 - cheaper than single mode fiber(cheaper LED based SFP transmitters) 

Single-mode fiber:
 - core diameter is narrower than multimode fiber, 
 - light enter at a single angle(mode) from a laser-based transmitter,
 - allows longer cables than both UTP and multimode fiber cables,
 - more expensive than multimode fiber due to more expensive laser based SFP transmitters 

--- Ethernet standards (fiber optic) ---


Informal name	IEEE Standard	Speed	Cable Type	Max length

1000BASE-LX	802.3z		1 Gbps	Multi or single	550m (MM), 5km (SM)
10GBASE-SR	802.3ae 	10 Gbps	Multi		400m
10GBASE-LR	802.3ae		10 Gbps	Single		10 km
10GBASE-ER	802.3ae		10 Gbps	Single		30 km


--- Presentation layer ----

Translates data to the appropriate format. Data in the application layer is in 'application format'.
Therefore it has to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network. 

--- Session layer ----

Controls dialogues (sessions) between communicating hosts. Establishes, and terminates
connections between local app and the remote one(for example my browser and youtube).

--- Transport layer ----

Layers 7,6,5 provide a Data. 

Segments and reassembles(składać ponownie) data for communications between end hosts. Breaks large pieces of data
into smaller segments which can be more easily sent over the network and less likely to cause
transmission problems if errors occur. Provide host to host communication.

Data + Layer 4 prepares Segment. Each segment consists of [Data][L4 Header]

--- Network layer --- 

Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks(outside of LAN).
Provides logical addressing(IP addresses).
Provides path selection between source and destination. 
Routers operate at Layer 3. 

[Data][L4 header][L3 header] => it is called a packet

--- Data link ---

Provides node to node connectivity and data transfer(e.g. Pc to switch, switch to router etc).
Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium(for example copper UTP cables).

Switches operate at layer 2. 

[L2 trailer][Data][L4 header][L3 header][L2 header] => it is called a frame

--- Physical layer ---

Defines physical characteristics of the medium to transfer data between devices.
For example voltage levels, max transmission distances etc. 

Digital bits are converted into electrical or radio signals.
