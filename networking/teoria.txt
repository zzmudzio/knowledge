==== NETWORK DEVICES ===

- Client -> it is a device that accesses a service made available by the server
- Server -> a device that provides functions or services for clients


--- Switch ----

Is used for forwarding traffic in a LAN(Local Area Network)

Examples of switches are: Catalyst 9200, catalyst 3650

They have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to(usually 24+)

They do NOT provide connectivity between LAN/s / over the Internet. 

--- Routers ---

Example of routers are: ISR 1000, ISR 900, ISR 4000

They are used to provide connectivity between LANs. They have fewer network interfaces than switches. 
They are used to send the data over the Internet. 

--- Network Firewalls ---

They are a special devices that controll entering and leaving network traffic. 
They can be placed outside of the router and inside of the network. 
They have to be configured with given security rules to determine which traffic should be allowed and which not. 

Example firewalls: ASA5500-X, Firepower 2100

Asa stands for adaptive security appliance. 

Next-Generation Firewalls are the ones which include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities. 
The above mentioned models are considered as next-gen fws. 

--- Host-based firewalls ---

They are a software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine. 


==== INTERFACES AND CABLES ===

RJ - Registered Jack
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

--- Ethernet standards(copper) ----

Speed	Common name	IEEE Standard	Informal name	Max length
10 Mbps  Ethernet	802.3i		10BASE-T	100m
100 Mbps Fast Ethernet	802.3u		100BASE-T	100m
1Gbps	 Gigabit Eth.	802.3ab		1000BASE-T	100m
10Gbps	 10 Gig Eth.	802.3an		10GBASE-T	100m

--- UTP Cables ---

UTP - unshielded twisted pair - no metallic shield so vulnerable to electromagnetic interference(zakłócenia)

There are 8 pins, 4 pairs

-- Ethernet, Fast Ethernet --

Ethernet, Fast Ethernet use 2 pairs(4 wires).

Full Duplex - two devices can send and receive data on the same time. 

PC sends data on pins 1,2 and receives on 3 and 6. 
Switch sends data on pins 3 and 6, and receives on 1 and 2. 
Router sends data on pins 1,2 and receives on 3 and 6. 
Firewall sends data on pins 1,2 and receives on 3 and 6. 

-- Straight through cable ---

Pin 1 on one end of the rj 45 copper cable connects straight through to the pin 1 on the other end etc.

-- Crossover cable ---

Pin 3 on one end of the rj 45 copper cable connects to the pin 1 on the other end etc.

Switch:

Pin 1 < 3 
Pin 2 < 6
Pin 3 > 1
Pin 6 > 2
